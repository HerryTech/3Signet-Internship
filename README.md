# Internship
Educational institutions face the challenge of identifying students at risk of dropping out in order to intervene early and improve retention rates. This project aims to develop and optimize predictive models to forecast student dropout rates and recommend effective interventions. By leveraging data science techniques such as machine learning algorithms, feature engineering, and data analysis, this project seeks to identify key factors influencing student success, and provide actionable insights to improve student retention.
### Technologies:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Streamlit
- Jupyter Notebook
### Dataset
- Number of records: 4,424 rows and 37 columns with no missing values.
- Features: Previous qualification grade, age at enrollment, 1st and 2nd semester curriculum details, debtor status, scholarship holder etc.
### Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run the project, you will need:
- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`
### Models and Approach
The following machine learning algorithms were tested and tuned to improve prediction accuracy:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Support Vector Machine

The final model selection was based on performance metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-Score.
### Results
- Best Model: Random Forest with 77% accuracy.
