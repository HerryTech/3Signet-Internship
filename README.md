# 3Signet Data Science Internship
This repository contains all the projects, analyses, and learnings from my data science internship at 3Signet. From data cleaning and exploration to machine learning models, this space showcases my progress, contributions, and key insights throughout the internship journey.
## Project 1
Educational institutions face the challenge of identifying students at risk of dropping out in order to intervene early and improve retention rates. This project aims to develop and optimize predictive models to forecast student dropout rates and recommend effective interventions. By leveraging data science techniques such as machine learning algorithms, feature engineering, and data analysis, this project seeks to identify key factors influencing student success and provide actionable insights to improve student retention.
